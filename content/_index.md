# Welcome to My Portfolio

I'm a computational biologist and software developer passionate about leveraging technology to advance biological research. My work combines computer vision, data analysis, and interactive visualization to solve complex problems in cellular biology.

## Featured Project

### [Cellvis - BioVision](projects/cellvis)

An end-to-end 3D cellular analysis platform for tracking and analyzing stem cell behavior in Drosophila germaria. This project bridges advanced imaging techniques with computational analysis to make large-scale biological data easier to interpret and quantify.

**Key Features:**
- 3D segmentation and mesh generation for time-lapse microscopy
- Automated cell tracking across multiple timepoints
- Unsupervised clustering to identify cell behavior patterns
- Interactive GUI for visualization and parameter adjustment
