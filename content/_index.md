# Welcome to My Portfolio


## Featured Project

### [Cellvis - BioVision](projects/cellvis)

An end-to-end 3D cellular analysis platform for tracking and analyzing stem cell behavior in Drosophila germaria. This project bridges advanced imaging techniques with computational analysis to make large-scale biological data easier to interpret and quantify.

**Features:**
- 3D segmentation and mesh generation for 3D time-lapse microscopy
- Automated cell tracking across multiple timepoints through cell matching algorithm
- Unsupervised clustering to identify cell behavior patterns
- Interactive GUI for visualization and parameter adjustment

## About Me

I'm a first-year Computer Science and Math student at UMD, where I spend most of my time thinking about how to make computers help biologists. For the past few years, I've been working on machine learning applications in biological imaging, building tools to analyze and visualize cellular structures and discover meaningful patterns that reveal how cells organize and behave.
