# Cellvis - BioVision

## Overview

BioVision is an end-to-end computational platform for analyzing 3D time-lapse images of germaria — the regions in Drosophila ovaries where stem cells divide and differentiate. The goal is to automatically identify and track cells across stacks and timepoints to better understand their behavior and organization.

## Project Description

Our project focuses on bridging the gap between advanced microscopy imaging and computational analysis to make large-scale cellular data easier to interpret and quantify.

### The Pipeline

The pipeline starts with **raw microscopy stacks**, which we process using 3D segmentation techniques to isolate individual cells. After segmentation, we generate 3D meshes for each cell to preserve their shapes and spatial context. From these meshes, we extract various morphological and spatial features — such as cell volume, surface area, position, and orientation — which serve as numerical representations of cell behavior over time.

### Analysis & Clustering

Once features are extracted, we apply **unsupervised clustering algorithms** (like K-means) to group cells with similar properties or behaviors. This helps reveal potential biological patterns, such as regions with coordinated growth or cells transitioning between states.

### Interactive Visualization

We built the entire system with a **graphical user interface (GUI)** that allows researchers to visualize the segmentation, meshes, and clustering results interactively. Users can explore slices, stacks, or full 3D renderings and adjust clustering parameters on the fly.

## Key Features

- **3D Segmentation**: Advanced techniques to isolate individual cells from microscopy stacks
- **Mesh Generation**: Preservation of cell shapes and spatial context through 3D mesh models
- **Feature Extraction**: Morphological and spatial analysis (volume, surface area, position, orientation)
- **Automated Tracking**: Cell identification and tracking across multiple timepoints
- **Unsupervised Clustering**: K-means and other algorithms to identify behavioral patterns
- **Interactive GUI**: Real-time visualization and parameter adjustment
- **Multi-dimensional Visualization**: Explore data through slices, stacks, or full 3D renderings

## Technical Stack

## Conclusion

Overall, BioVision bridges imaging and computation, providing an end-to-end tool for 3D cellular analysis that makes large-scale germarium data easier to interpret and quantify. This project demonstrates the power of combining computer vision, machine learning, and interactive visualization to solve real-world biological research problems.
